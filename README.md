# MilesPerGallonRevisited
Chapter 15 Example Project: Miles Per Gallon Revisited. In Ch 7 in the previous course, you created a project for calculating miles per gallon for a single trip and for cumulative trips. In this project, you will use the same class named MPG. It has instance variables for miles and gallons for a trip, total miles and total gallons for the cumulative calculation, and methods to instantiate a trip, display current MPG, and display total MPG. (Hint: after creating a new project here, create the new class, and copy all of the code from the Ch 7 MPG class into the Ch 15 MPG class.)
